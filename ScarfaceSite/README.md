My universitary project of the Laboratory of Visual Comunication course.
The aim was to build a website centered on a film we had to choose. I've chosen Scarface.
We started from developing the website at a high level using Figma.
In the Figma file (accesible thanks to the link), it's possible to find the site low and high-fidelity wireframes and the mockups. 
here, it's also possible to find the choices regarding typography, palette, navigation elements and images.
In the end we coded all using HTML and CSS.
