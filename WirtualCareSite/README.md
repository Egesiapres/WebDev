A project realized during the Web Intruments and Application course, in the first year of the Master degree.
The aim was to build a thematic blog using Wordpress and manage it as an editorial staff.
Me and my team customized the site especially thanks to Elementor, and pulished an article every week for 6 weeks.
In the end, each one of us also published a more large and detailed final article.
