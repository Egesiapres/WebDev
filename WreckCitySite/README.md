My university project of the Visual Communication and Interfaces Design.
1) Aim: each group had to build a website centered on an immaginary city. Me and my team decided to base it on a Steampunk one.
2) Guide lines: the site had to be designed and realized for different devices (mobile, tablet and desktop) following the mobile-first philosophy, 
3) Process: 
  3.1) We started from developing the website at a high level using Figma. In the Figma file (accessible thanks to the link), it's possible to find 
the site low and high-fidelity wireframes and mockups of each different website version. Here, it's also possible to find the choices regarding 
typography, palette, navigation elements and images.
In the end we coded all using HTML, CSS and a bit of JS.
